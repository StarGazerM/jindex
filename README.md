# Jindex

--------------------------


Jindex is a web java syntax indexer. Most idea of this little toy come from some other project for example rubysonar/pysonar. 

Basically it is an m-CFA based static analysis tool. It will do pointer analysis to a code snippit and helping a web component to do something like syntax matching, code navigation.

*NOTE: this is just a course project for syracuse's CSE687 course :-)*
